Turn WordPress into a reusable AI production system. Connect Claude and other MCP-compatible assistants to pages, products, Elementor parts, archetypes, design references, and site character.

== Description ==

MUCP connects your WordPress site to AI assistants like Claude using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Instead of generating isolated one-off pages, it helps operators build with reusable structure: guided site character, Elementor parts, page archetypes, WooCommerce product archetypes, and design references from screenshots or Figma. Your AI assistant can create drafts, preserve brand patterns, save reusable sections back into the library, and manage the rest of WordPress through natural language. Every feature is free.

= Key Features =

* **Content Management** - Create, edit, and delete posts and pages
* **Media Handling** - Upload files or import from URLs
* **Draft Management** - List and bulk-delete drafts
* **Full Elementor** - Get/set Elementor data, templates, landing pages, widget control
* **Elementor 4 Ready** - Tested on WordPress 6.9.1 with Elementor 4.0.0, with verified fallback when Elementor's document save does not persist data
* **SEO Tools** - Yoast, RankMath, AIOSEO, SEOPress integration
* **Forms** - Contact Form 7, WPForms, Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms
* **WooCommerce** - Products, orders, customers, categories, analytics
* **AI Integrations** - Image generation, stock photos, text-to-speech, alt text, and Figma design intake
* **Structured Design System** - Reusable Elementor parts, page archetypes, product archetypes, guided site character, and image-based design references
* **Operator Workflow** - Onboarding, library curation, draft-first generation, provenance, and recovery-friendly update guidance
* **Theme Builder** - Create and manage Elementor theme templates
* **Secure API** - API key authentication with activity logging
* **MCP Compatible** - Works with Claude Code and Claude Desktop
* **200+ MCP Tools** - All features included, no paid tiers

= How It Works =

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Copy your API key from mumcp in the admin menu
3. Configure your MCP server with the API key
4. Define your site character and save reusable assets like archetypes, parts, and design references
5. Start building draft pages and products with natural language

= Example Commands =

* "Create a blog post about summer recipes"
* "Run an SEO audit on all published pages"
* "Build a landing page from our SaaS archetype and reuse the pricing proof section"
* "Save this screenshot as a design reference, create a draft page from it, and keep strong sections as reusable parts"
* "Upload this image and set it as the featured image for post 123"

== Installation ==

= From WordPress Admin =

1. Go to Plugins → Add New
2. Search for "mumcp"
3. Click Install Now, then Activate
4. Go to mumcp in the admin menu to get your API key

= Manual Installation =

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Go to Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
3. Select the ZIP file and click Install Now
4. Activate the plugin
5. Go to mumcp in the admin menu to get your API key

= MCP Server Setup =

Add to your `~/.claude.json`:

`{
  "mcpServers": {
    "site-pilot-ai": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "WP_URL": "https://yoursite.com",
        "WP_API_KEY": "spai_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is MCP? =

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with external tools and services. mumcp exposes your WordPress site as an MCP-compatible tool.

= Is this secure? =

Yes. All requests require a unique API key. Keys are hashed using WordPress password hashing (not stored in plain text). A dedicated service account with limited capabilities handles API requests. Activity logging tracks all API usage for auditing.

= Does it work with any AI? =

MUCP works with any AI assistant that supports the MCP protocol. Currently, this includes Claude Code and Claude Desktop. More integrations are planned.

= Do I need coding skills? =

No. Once configured, you control WordPress through natural language. The AI handles all the technical details.

= What about Elementor? =

Full Elementor support is included: get/set page data, templates, landing pages, widgets, reusable parts, page archetypes, and full page building capabilities. All features are free.

= Who is this for? =

MUCP is best for operators: founders, marketers, agencies, and site managers who ship pages or products repeatedly and want AI to work from approved structure instead of rebuilding everything from scratch.

= Does it support Elementor 4? =

Yes. The current stack has been tested on WordPress 6.9.1 with Elementor 4.0.0. mumcp verifies that Elementor saves actually persist `_elementor_data`, and automatically falls back to a direct meta save when Elementor reports success but stores nothing. Landing page generation was also verified on the local Elementor 4 test stack.

= Can I use this on multiple sites? =

Each site needs its own plugin installation and API key. Multi-site management features are included.
