## North Star (product thesis)

> MCPWP is **autonomous brand marketing that lives in WordPress** — not "a WordPress plugin."
> A sovereign Cloudflare "pot" ([mupot](https://github.com/Mumega-com/mupot)) runs a WordPress
> business as living agents, packaged as **vertical snapshots** (mupot pack + MCPWP site-blueprint),
> resold by agencies. GoHighLevel's go-to-market, on a far stronger substrate: open WordPress
> capability + living agents + sovereign (customer's own CF) + no per-seat tax.
>
> **Beachhead:** WooCommerce stores (vertical ROI), agencies as the resale channel. LearnPress = fast-follow vertical.
> **Moat:** governance (approval → apply → **rollback** + audit) + the brand-crystal (site-context +
> content-coherence + site-memory → on-brand, not slop). Full thesis + pricing + unit economics live in
> agent memory `mcpwp-gtm-strategy.md`.

## Milestone Map — MVP → Full (traced to major versions)

```
SHIPPED  v2.8.45–v2.8.51  analytics · agency proxy · audit+rollback · white-label · site-memory
                          · signals · blueprints · chat · hook API · find-replace fix
                          └─ these are the BONES of the autonomous-marketing engine

NOW ─ MVP PILOT (no version bump, runs on current builds) ───────────────────────────────
  P0  Autonomous-Marketing PROOF LOOP — hand-wired, one instance:
      1 Woo store → MCPWP + 1 mupot pot → marketing squad (keyword→on-brand content→SEO→product page)
      → Telegram channel (owner approves) → 1 agency.  + measure real $/task.
      Validates the ENTIRE thesis before anything is productized.

PHASE A — Foundation & Distribution ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  M1  Launch-Ready              v2.8.x   free plugin + Pro; beachhead entry   ← Hadi gates (T87 pricing)
  M2  Distribution              v2.9     WP.org · ChatGPT GPT · MCP registries · Claude Connector
  M3  Auth Layer                v3.0     OAuth 2.1 — unblocks hosted agent + app directories

PHASE B — Autonomous Marketing (productize the MVP) ───────────────────────────────────────
  M4  Hosted Marketing Agent    v3.2     agent.mcpwp.net + mupot integration = the MVP loop, productized
  M5  Content Engine            v4.0     keyword research · Telegram/social distribution · Remotion video

PHASE C — Platform & THE FULL VISION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  M6  Platform Foundations      v5.0     spai_→mcpwp_ rebrand + microkernel
  M7  Snapshot System           v6.0     vertical snapshots (mupot pack + MCPWP blueprint): Woo, LearnPress
  M8  Agency Reseller (FULL)    v6.x     white-label SaaS-mode · client sub-billing · snapshot marketplace
                                         · sovereign deploy  =  THE FULL ONE
```

**The MVP→Full trace (the spine):** P0 is one hand-built snapshot loop → M4 productizes that loop as a
hosted agent → M7 generalizes it into reusable vertical snapshots → M8 sells/resells them at scale (the
GHL model). The full vision lands at **v6.0–v6.x**, gated behind M3 (auth) + M4 (hosted agent) + M6
(platform hardening). **The MVP pilot is doable NOW on current builds** — don't wait for v3 to prove it.

---

## P0 — Autonomous-Marketing MVP Proof Loop (do this FIRST)

The smallest thing that validates the whole North Star. Runs on **current builds** — no v3 dependency.
Build ONE loop end-to-end, measure it, decide go/no-go before productizing anything.

| # | GH | Who | Task | Status |
|---|-----|-----|------|--------|
| P0a | #449 | agent | **Measure real $/task** — ✅ measured tool-schema weight (free ~20k / all 269 = ~35k tokens/turn); page-build ≈ $0.9 Haiku / $2.5 Sonnet cached. Caching + tool-subsetting mandatory. Full hosted-agent run pending M4. | ✅ done |
| P0b | #454 | agent | **Keyword-research MCP tool** — ✅ shipped v2.8.52: `wp_keyword_research` (keyless Google Suggest → keywords + questions). 17 tests, Sonnet SSRF review, live on crophelp.ai. | ✅ done |
| P0c | #450 | both | **Wire the loop** — 1 Woo store → MCPWP + 1 mupot pot → marketing squad → Telegram approval. Hand-wired, no productization. | ⏳ |
| P0d | — | Hadi | **1 pilot agency + 1 pilot store** — the human side of the proof (would they pay?). | ⏳ |

Epics: M4 #451 · M7 #452 · M8 #453.

**Exit test:** loop runs, content is on-brand (brand-crystal holds), agency says yes → thesis validated → build M4.

| PH account | Hadi must be the maker |
| Pricing decision | Can't write pricing page without numbers |
| Privacy policy review | Can draft, Hadi must approve legal text |
| WP.org account | Hadi submits manually |

**Agent tasks remaining in M1:** none — all done. Launch blocked on Hadi gates above.

---

## M2 — Multi-Client Distribution (v2.9)

### Depends on: M1 complete, T03/T04 testing passed

| # | GH | Task |
|---|-----|------|
| T01 | #378 | Test Claude Desktop + Claude Code (local) |
| T02 | #379 | Test Claude Code against localhost:8080 |
| T03 | #380 | Test OpenClaw streamable-http + X-API-Key header (bug #65590) |
| T04 | #381 | Test Hermes Agent + Tool Search activation |
| ~~T10~~ | #383 | ~~Update openapi-chatgpt.yaml for v2.8.49~~ — ✅ PR #446 (now v2.8.50, 49 ops) |

| ~~T52~~ | #407 | ~~BM25-optimized tool descriptions~~ — ✅ PR #446 (56 descriptions rewritten) |

### What I lack for M2

| Need | Why |
|------|-----|
| ChatGPT Plus | GPT Store publishing |
| Test results T03/T04 | Can't publish ClawHub/Hermes skills blind |
| WP.org account | Submission |

---

## M2.5 — Custom Tool Registry (v2.9 add-on, can ship independently)

MCPWP becomes a platform runtime. Third-party plugins (Digid, WooCommerce extensions, booking plugins) register their own MCP tools. Every WP site becomes a programmable agent surface specific to that business.

| # | GH | Task | Notes |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| ~~T71a~~ | #439 | ~~Plugin hook API (`spai_register_tools` filter)~~ | ✅ PR #446 — Spai_Custom_Tool_Registry, dispatch via rest_path |
| T71b | #440 | REST proxy tools (no-code external endpoints) | Admin defines tool → MCPWP proxies to external URL. No PHP needed. |
| T71c | #441 | Visual tool builder UI (WP Admin sandbox) | Form-based tool creator with inline test panel. Layer on top of T71b. |

**T71a can ship in M2 — independent of OAuth, no blockers.**

---

## M3 — Auth Layer (v3.0)

### Depends on: M2 shipped

| # | GH | Task | Notes |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| T60 | #408 | OAuth 2.1 central CF Worker (auth.mcpwp.net) | Unlocks ChatGPT App + Claude Connector + YouTube + GHL |
| T61 | — | ChatGPT App Directory submission | Needs T60 |
| T62 | — | Claude Connector directory submission | Needs T60 |

### What I lack for M3

OAuth 2.1 + PKCE is a significant build. Needs Opus-level spec session before implementation.

---

## M4 — Hosted Agent + Resold Compute (v3.2)

### Depends on: M3 (OAuth layer)

| # | GH | Task | Notes |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| T100 | #429 | McpAgent Worker (agent.mcpwp.net) | Stateful DO per session. BYOK or pooled Workers AI. **Spec: Opus** |
| T101 | #430 | AI Gateway for all LLM calls | Free logging + per-site cost tracking |
| T102 | #431 | Vectorize semantic tool search | 85% token reduction per agent turn |
| T113 | #435 | Telegram bot client | First chat platform — no OAuth, inline approval keyboards |
| T114 | #436 | Slack bot client | Team member play for agencies |
| T115 | #437 | Discord bot client | Developer/OSS audience |

---

## M5 — Content Engine (v4.0)

### Depends on: M4 (McpAgent + OAuth)

| # | GH | Task | Notes |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| T110 | #432 | Content Engine spec (post → video → YouTube → GHL) | **Spec: Opus** |
| T111 | #433 | Remotion branded video templates | React → MP4, brand props from wp_remember |
| T112 | #434 | GoHighLevel integration | Social + CRM, OAuth via T60 |

---

## M6 — Platform Foundations (v5.0)

### Depends on: M5 shipped, community stable

Clean-slate internals. One breaking release, done right.

| # | GH | Task | Notes |
|---|-----|------|-------|
| T126 | — | Rebrand: `spai_` → `mcpwp_`, REST `site-pilot-ai/v1` → `mcpwp/v1` | Deprecation shims for one major version. **Spec: Opus** |
| T127 | — | Microkernel refactor: dissolve monolithic tool classes into self-registering modules | Each tool category = one `module.php` using `mcpwp_register_tools`. Same pattern as third-party. **Spec: Opus** |
| T128 | — | `mcpwp:dev` skill (updated post-microkernel) | Agent onboarding for the new module pattern |

**Rule:** T126 + T127 ship together in v5.0. One breaking change window, not two.

---

## M7 — Snapshot System (v6.0)

### Depends on: M4 (hosted agent) + M6 (microkernel makes packaging clean)

Generalize the P0 proof loop into reusable **vertical snapshots**. A snapshot = a **mupot pack**
(agent squad + marketing skills + channel binding + governance) **+ an MCPWP site-blueprint**
(WordPress site: pages, Woo/LearnPress config, SEO, brand-crystal). Both halves already exist as
contract-defined bundles (mupot `packs/` + `wp_deploy_site_blueprint`).

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| T130 | Snapshot format spec (mupot pack ⊕ MCPWP blueprint) | The contract that fuses both halves. **Spec: Opus** |
| T131 | WooCommerce vertical snapshot | First productized snapshot — opinionated stack (ship theme + required plugins → portability) |
| T132 | LearnPress vertical snapshot | Second vertical (course creators) |
| T133 | mupot ↔ MCPWP harness pack | A mupot flock agent gets a scoped MCP connection to the client's WP site + marketing skills. Seam already in pack contract. |
| T134 | Snapshot deploy/clone flow | One-click deploy a snapshot into a fresh pot + WP site (the GHL-clone equivalent) |

**Hard problem to respect:** WordPress is heterogeneous (themes/builders/plugins) where GHL is uniform.
Solve with **opinionated stack per vertical** (snapshot ships the theme + plugin set) — uniformity is
what makes snapshots portable. Do NOT target arbitrary existing sites first.

---

## M8 — Agency Reseller / SaaS-Mode (v6.x) — THE FULL VISION

### Depends on: M7 (snapshots) + M3 (auth) + sovereign mupot deploy

The full GHL-style motion, on the sovereign substrate.

| # | Task | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| T140 | Agency white-label SaaS-mode | Rebrand + resell snapshots as the agency's own product |
| T141 | Client sub-billing + compute markup | Agency rebills clients; pass model cost through with markup (GHL SaaS-mode model) |
| T142 | Snapshot marketplace | Agencies publish/sell vertical snapshots (the GHL snapshot-marketplace analog) |
| T143 | Sovereign one-click deploy | Fork → deploy mupot to the customer's OWN Cloudflare ("fork it, own it") |

**This is THE FULL ONE.** Build NOTHING here until the P0 loop + at least one M7 snapshot are proven.
Marketplace before a working snapshot = death.

---

## Technical Debt (fix as we go)

| # | GH | Severity | Task |
|---|-----|----------|------|
| T120 | #442 | medium | Split free/pro tool files — 2000+ line classes block contributors |
| T121 | #443 | high | PHPUnit tests — zero PHP test coverage, silent deploy failures |
| ~~T122~~ | #444 | high | ~~Rewrite 120+ tool descriptions for BM25/vector accuracy~~ | ✅ PR #446 |
| ~~T123~~ | #445 | launch-blocker | ~~Update openapi-chatgpt.yaml to v2.8.49~~ | ✅ PR #446 (v2.8.50) |
| T124 | — | medium | `mcpwp:dev` skill — agent onboarding for plugin dev: add-a-tool pattern, version bump 3-file rule, local test stack, CI, `spai_register_tools` usage |
| T125 | — | medium | Update `mumcp:tools` skill — stale at 239 tools, missing custom tool registry, missing new endpoints |

## Architecture Notes

### T126 — Rebrand (`spai_` → `mcpwp_`)

Every public surface uses the wrong prefix today:
- WP option keys: `spai_api_keys`, `spai_settings`, `spai_site_uuid`, …
- Hook names: `spai_tool_called`, `spai_register_rest_routes`, `spai_register_tools`, …
- REST namespace: `site-pilot-ai/v1` (should be `mcpwp/v1`)
- Class names: `Spai_*` throughout
- MCP tool names: `wp_*` (these are fine — keep)

**Breaking change scope:** Any site with custom hooks on `spai_*` or hitting `site-pilot-ai/v1` directly breaks. Must ship with:
1. Deprecated aliases for all old option keys (copy on read, write new)
2. Old REST namespace forwarded to new for one major version
3. `spai_tool_called` → fires both old + new name during transition

**When:** v3.0, after WP.org submission. Do not do before launch — WP.org review + existing installs.

### T127 — Microkernel Refactor

Current structure: two monolithic classes (`Spai_MCP_Free_Tools`, `Spai_MCP_Pro_Tools`) each 2000+ lines, extending a base registry. All 250+ tools live in two files.

**Target structure (microkernel):**
```
includes/
  kernel/
    class-mcpwp-kernel.php        # bootstrap, hook registry, dispatch
    class-mcpwp-tool-dispatch.php # MCP tool routing (replaces class-spai-rest-mcp.php core)
  modules/
    pages/       module.php       # registers wp_create_page, wp_update_page, …
    elementor/   module.php       # registers wp_get_elementor, wp_set_elementor, …
    media/       module.php
    seo/         module.php
    memory/      module.php
    blueprints/  module.php
    …
  api/           (unchanged — REST controllers stay)
```

Each `module.php`:
```php
add_filter('mcpwp_register_tools', function($tools) {
    $tools[] = [ 'name' => 'wp_create_page', ... ];
    return $tools;
});
```

**Result:**
- T120 (split files) becomes the first migration step
- Free/Pro split is a capability filter on the module, not a class hierarchy
- Third-party plugins (Digid, WooCommerce ext) use exact same pattern as built-ins — no special case
- Contributors can add a tool by editing one focused module file
- Modules are independently testable

**Dependency:** T126 (rebrand) should ship same release — do both as v3.0.
**Spec:** Needs Opus session before implementation. Not mechanical work.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| ChatGPT Custom GPT first, App Store later | Custom GPT works with X-API-Key today. App Store needs OAuth. |
| OAuth via central CF Worker | One submission URL. One OAuth flow per user. |
| Claude Connector via Desktop Extension first | MCPB handles per-user URL + API key — ships before OAuth. |
| Don't publish ClawHub/Hermes until tested | OpenClaw bug #65590. Ship quality, not speed. |
| WP.org free version separate build | `scripts/build-wporg.sh` strips pro. Don't submit full zip. |
| Close premium to private repo | Standard commercial WP model. Decision pending (#423). |
