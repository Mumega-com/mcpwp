Connect WordPress to Claude and other MCP clients for safe AI-assisted posts, pages, media, drafts, and Elementor basics.

== Description ==

MCPWP connects your WordPress site to AI assistants like Claude using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It gives approved AI clients a scoped, auditable way to read site context and help manage core WordPress content through natural language.

The WordPress.org package is the free core: API keys, scoped access, activity logging, posts, pages, media, drafts, menus, site context, and basic Elementor operations when Elementor is installed.

= Key Features =

* **Secure MCP Access** - Connect MCP-capable clients with hashed API keys and scoped permissions
* **Content Management** - Create, edit, and delete posts and pages
* **Media Handling** - Upload files or import media from URLs
* **Draft Management** - List and clean up drafts
* **Menus and Site Context** - Read site structure and basic navigation data
* **Basic Elementor Support** - Read and update Elementor page data when Elementor is installed
* **Activity Log** - Audit API and MCP activity from wp-admin
* **Tool Controls** - Disable tool categories that should not be exposed to agents
* **MCP Compatible** - Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible clients

= How It Works =

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Copy your API key from MCPWP in the admin menu
3. Configure your MCP server with the API key
4. Review enabled tool categories and scopes
5. Start creating drafts and managing WordPress content with natural language

= Example Commands =

* "Create a blog post about summer recipes"
* "Create a draft landing page for our spring campaign"
* "List recent drafts and delete the unused ones"
* "Upload this image and set it as the featured image for post 123"
* "Read the site context before updating the About page"

== Installation ==

= From WordPress Admin =

1. Go to Plugins → Add New
2. Search for "MCPWP"
3. Click Install Now, then Activate
4. Go to MCPWP in the admin menu to get your API key

= Manual Installation =

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Go to Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin
3. Select the ZIP file and click Install Now
4. Activate the plugin
5. Go to MCPWP in the admin menu to get your API key

= MCP Server Setup =

Add to your `~/.claude.json`:

`{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpwp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "WP_URL": "https://yoursite.com",
        "WP_API_KEY": "mcpwp_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is MCP? =

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with external tools and services. MCPWP exposes your WordPress site as an MCP-compatible tool.

= Is this secure? =

Yes. All requests require a unique API key. Keys are hashed using WordPress password hashing (not stored in plain text). A dedicated service account with limited capabilities handles API requests. Activity logging tracks all API usage for auditing.

= Does it work with any AI? =

MCPWP works with any AI assistant that supports the MCP protocol. Currently, this includes Claude Code and Claude Desktop. More integrations are planned.

= Do I need coding skills? =

No. Once configured, you control WordPress through natural language. The AI handles all the technical details.

= What about Elementor? =

Basic Elementor page read/write support is included when Elementor is installed. Advanced Elementor Pro and theme-builder workflows are not part of the WordPress.org free package.

= Who is this for? =

MCPWP is best for site owners, developers, agencies, and content teams that want AI assistants to help operate WordPress while keeping API keys, scopes, and activity logs under site-owner control.

= Does it support Elementor 4? =

Yes. MCPWP includes fallback handling for Elementor page data saves.

= Can I use this on multiple sites? =

Each site needs its own plugin installation and API key.

== Privacy ==

MCPWP can send anonymous usage data from your WordPress server to PostHog when the "Share anonymous tool-usage data" setting is enabled in WP Admin > MCPWP > Settings.

**What is collected:** Names of MCP tools called, whether each call succeeded or failed, execution duration, plugin version, WordPress version, and PHP major/minor version.

**What is NOT collected:** Post content, page content, user data, API keys, site URL, or any personally identifiable information.

**Identifier:** Each site is assigned a random site UUID (e.g. mcpwp-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx). This UUID is stored in wp_options and cannot be traced back to a domain name or individual.

**Where data is sent:** PostHog, Inc. (posthog.com). Your server's outbound IP address is transmitted as part of the HTTP request to PostHog.

**Default state:** Disabled for free tier (requires opt-in). Enabled by default for paid subscribers (can be disabled at any time).

**How to opt out:** Uncheck "Share anonymous tool-usage data" under WP Admin > MCPWP > Settings.

== Screenshots ==

1. Control Room — supervised approvals, SEO findings, rollback-ready changes, and recommended next actions
2. Setup — MCP endpoint, client configuration, and role-scoped API key management
3. Tools — category controls for agent capability discovery and execution enforcement
4. Integrations and Chat — connected services plus safety-first agent workflow

== Changelog ==

= 3.2.2 =
* New: Calling a Pro tool on a Free install now returns a clear upgrade-path error (JSON-RPC -32004 `pro_required` with plan and pricing link) instead of "unknown tool".
* Improved: `/introspect` is compact by default (tool name + summary, ~80% smaller) so AI clients no longer overflow their context; pass `?full=true` for the legacy payload with full schemas.
* Fixed: `/option` now refuses to overwrite an array/object option with a plain string (decodes valid JSON; `force_type_change=true` to override) — prevents accidental destruction of structured options such as Elementor theme-builder conditions.
* Fixed: numeric values in API responses are returned as JSON numbers (analytics counts, Elementor `page_id`) for typed clients.

= 3.2.1 =
* Maintenance: Internal rebrand cleanup (spai→mcpwp) — cron label, code comments, and admin JS object renamed. Webhook deliveries now also emit `X-MCPWP-Signature`, `X-MCPWP-Event`, and `X-MCPWP-Webhook-ID` headers alongside the existing `X-SPAI-*` headers (both sets sent; `X-SPAI-*` retained for backward-compat). MCP tools/list response now also includes an `x_mcpwp` envelope key alongside `x_spai`. Bridge migration of legacy sites is unchanged.

= 3.2.0 =
* New: Minimal OAuth 2.1 authorization server — MCP clients (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT) can now authenticate via browser sign-in instead of API keys. Adds RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata, RFC 8414 authorization-server metadata, PKCE S256 authorize endpoint, and token exchange (authorization_code + refresh_token). X-API-Key authentication is unchanged and unaffected. Requires `oauth_enabled` setting + allow-listed redirect URIs to activate.
* Fix: `wp_recall` tool PHP 8.x compatibility (#534).

= 3.1.0 =
* New: Seamless migration bridge — sites upgrading from the earlier `site-pilot-ai` build carry over all content, API keys, OAuth access tokens, plugin settings, and licensing entitlement automatically. Existing API keys keep authenticating during and after the change; migration is idempotent and non-destructive (original data is left intact for rollback).
* New: Dual-prefix authentication — legacy keys and OAuth tokens continue to work alongside new `mcpwp_` credentials, with original scopes preserved.
* Compliance: WordPress.org Plugin Check clean (0 errors) — the WordPress.org build makes no third-party network calls and ships under GPL-2.0.
* Docs: per-site cutover runbook and verified MCP client connect matrix added.

= 3.0.1 =
* Fix: signals fatal on every compute — `compute_seo_issues()` was calling the private `get_issues()` method and filtering on severity `critical` (which the store never writes). Now uses the public `list_issues(status=open, severity=error)`.
* Fix: `GET /signals` now lazily computes on first read — closes the permanently-empty feed on hosts where WP-Cron never fires (the mcpwp.net symptom). Response includes `last_computed`, `partial`, and `skipped_types`.
* Fix: `compute_pending_updates()` no longer calls `wp_update_plugins()` (remote requests to wordpress.org per plugin) on web requests — reads cached transient instead; network refresh is cron-only.
* Fix: Elementor broken-page checker fetches IDs only, then reads `_elementor_data` blobs one at a time — prevents large memory spikes.
* Improvement: `compute()` accepts a time budget; over-budget signal types are skipped with their stored values preserved and reported via `mcpwp_signals_meta` (`last_computed`, `skipped_types`, `partial`).
* Licensing: Freemius is now the single source of truth for entitlement — removed legacy Lemon Squeezy store and self-started 14-day local trial that could independently grant Pro. New canonical `get_license_info()` accessor guarantees `plan` and `is_pro` never contradict.
* Refactor (G1–G4): split four monolithic classes (REST Site 4531 lines, free/pro tool files, Admin 3491 lines, Elementor Basic 3299 lines) into focused per-surface controllers and trait groups — no behavior change.
* Hardening (G5): gateway tool-registration contract enforced — unknown tools rejected at `tools/call`, escalation vectors closed.

= 3.0.0 =
* Rebrand: the plugin is now **MCPWP** throughout — folder, main file, class names, function/option prefixes, constants, text domain, and REST namespace (`mcpwp/v1`). A clean reinstall is recommended; settings and API keys are re-created fresh.

= 2.8.56 =
* Fix: front-end fatal error ("Class Mcpwp_Elementor_Chat_Widget not found") when Elementor initialized widgets before the chat-widget class was defined. The Elementor chat widget is defined conditionally on Elementor being loaded; under some plugin load orders the file loaded first, leaving the class undefined while registration still ran. Registration is now guarded and skips safely instead of crashing the site.
* Fix: capability detection now refreshes immediately when a plugin is activated or deactivated. Previously the capabilities response (woocommerce, learnpress, etc.) was cached for up to an hour, so a newly-enabled integration could report as unavailable — making connected AI agents blind to tools that were actually ready to use. The cache is now cleared on plugin activate/deactivate.

= 2.8.55 =
* Improvement: Admin JavaScript consolidated into a single enqueued, cacheable asset — inline scripts removed from Setup, Tools, Chat, and Integrations pages; data now passed via wp_localize_script.
* Fix: PostHog analytics now initializes exactly once (was double-initialized on the Tools and Integrations pages).
* Fix: admin script now loads on every MCPWP page (Control Room and Chat previously missing it).
* Security: chat history JSON data element is now tag-escaped, preventing a stored message containing markup from breaking out of the script element.
* Design system: added surface/border/text and status color tokens plus a radius scale; consolidated the two badge styles into one; replaced hardcoded color/background values with tokens and status classes.

= 2.8.54 =
* Improvement: Control Room — empty-state guidance, in-page section navigation, change summaries on pending approvals, and a confirm step before applying changes.
* Improvement: Library — design-reference form split into Required/Optional groups, consistent cards, clearer empty states with calls to action.
* Improvement: Integrations — upgrade link always shown on Pro cards with per-provider unlock descriptions; version pill added; status messages translatable.
* Accessibility: input label associations, a tablet (1024px) responsive breakpoint, and fluid chat height.

= 2.8.53 =
* New: Setup onboarding checklist — a 3-step guide (generate key → connect → first tool call) so new users always know the next step.
* Improvement: Chat shows a "connect OpenAI or Gemini" notice when no AI provider is configured, instead of silently degrading.
* Accessibility: tool toggles now show a visible keyboard focus ring (WCAG 2.1 AA).
* Polish: clearer "Update channel" labeling on Setup; removed a large stale admin template; design-system font-weight and Action Log style cleanups.

= 2.8.52 =
* New: wp_keyword_research — keyless keyword research via Google Suggest. Expands a seed phrase into related keywords and grouped questions (long-tail terms, content ideas, SEO topic discovery). No API key required.

= 2.8.51 =
* Fix: wp_bulk_find_replace no longer returns "not found" for searches containing HTML tags or URL slashes. The pre-check ran on raw JSON (where < is stored as < and / as \/); it now matches on the decoded element tree.
* Fix: wp_bulk_find_replace no longer corrupts page structure when a search term overlaps Elementor vocabulary. Structural keys (elType, widgetType, id, isInner, structure) are excluded from replacement.
* Hardening: find-replace search term now requires a minimum length of 1.
* Tests: added Elementor find/replace regression suite.

= 2.8.50 =
* New: mcpwp_register_tools filter — third-party plugins register MCP tools with a simple array, no PHP class required.
* Improvement: 56 tool descriptions rewritten for BM25 accuracy — more specific verbs, synonyms, and use-case context.
* Docs: openapi-chatgpt.yaml updated to v2.8.50 (was stale at v1.0.60) — adds /onboard, menus, approvals, full Elementor edit suite, /batch, /settings, and 24 other missing endpoints. Now 49 operations.

= 2.8.49 =
* New: Blueprint Library (wp_list_site_blueprints / wp_get_site_blueprint / wp_deploy_site_blueprint / wp_extract_site_blueprint) — create multi-page site structures from 5 starter blueprints (law firm, restaurant, SaaS, real estate, portfolio) or save custom ones from your existing content.
* New: Chat Excellence — multi-model routing (OpenAI GPT-4o mini, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, Workers AI fallback), SSE streaming for token-by-token responses, persistent conversation history per user, Clear button, model indicator in header.
* New: Destructive tool confirmation — delete and rollback tools require explicit confirmation in chat before executing.
* New: Chat model picker in Settings — choose preferred model or let Auto detect the best available key.
* New: Site Blueprints panel in Library showing all custom and starter blueprints with deploy hints.

= 2.8.48 =
* New: Dynamic site memory (wp_remember / wp_recall / wp_forget / wp_list_memories) — AI decisions, brand rules, and preferences persist across sessions in structured namespaces (identity, constraints, history, preferences, contacts).
* New: Proactive site signals (wp_get_signals) — WordPress surfaces actionable issues without being asked: stale content, broken Elementor data, missing featured images, draft accumulation, plugin updates, SEO issues.
* New: Site Signals panel in Control Room with severity indicators and direct edit links.
* New: Memory count shown in Control Room alongside signal feed.
* Fix: Legacy mcpwp_site_context auto-migrated into identity namespace on first wp_recall call.

= 2.8.47 =
* New: White-label mode — set agency name, logo, primary color, and chat greeting in WP Admin > Settings.
* New: [mcpwp_chat] shortcode renders a branded floating chat button on any page or post.
* New: Elementor chat widget wrapping the [mcpwp_chat] shortcode (available in Elementor widget panel).
* New: Agency custom hostname routing in proxy worker (CNAME ai.agencyname.com → proxy.mcpwp.net via KV).

= 2.8.46 =
* New: AI action audit log — every write-tool call logged to DB with before/after state snapshots (EU AI Act compliance).
* New: One-click rollback for post/page updates and Elementor writes from Control Room.
* New: CSV export of action log for compliance reporting.
* New: Configurable log retention (default 90 days, daily auto-prune).

= 2.8.45 =
* New: Server-side MCP tool analytics — when enabled, sends anonymous tool call data (tool name, success/failure, duration) to PostHog. Opt-in for free tier, opt-out for paid. No site content or PII is ever collected.
* New: Site support UUID displayed in WP Admin > Settings with a Copy button. Share this ID when contacting MCPWP support.
* New: PostHog configurable via WP Admin > Integrations — token and host are no longer hardcoded.
* Docs: Added == Privacy == section to readme.txt per WP.org plugin guidelines.

= 2.8.44 =
* New: PostHog analytics integration — configure token via WP Admin > Integrations. Tracks 10 key admin actions: API key copy, connection test, upgrade click, scoped key create/revoke, integration save/remove, tool category toggle, AI client tab switch.
* Fix: PostHog token no longer hardcoded — removed default public token, must be configured per-site.

= 2.8.43 =
* Fix: wp_set_template_conditions now accepts both object form ({type, name, sub_name, sub_id}) and positional array form (["include", "singular", "product"]) — positional arrays were previously flattened to include>general due to wrong key lookup (#210).
* Fix: wp_get_elementor_globals now returns both system_typography and custom_typography under fonts, and system_colors + custom_colors under colors — previously only custom_typography was returned, hiding Elementor's 4 reserved defaults (#253).
* Fix: wp_upload_media_from_url tool definition now exposes filename, title, and alt parameters — the underlying PHP already supported them but they were missing from tools/list (#252).
* Fix: Elementor v4 atomic elements (e-heading, e-paragraph, e-button, etc.) now skip settings key validation — they use props/styles, not classic settings, so the validator was incorrectly flagging them (#211).
* Fix: Form widget static schema now includes button styling keys (button_color, button_background_color, button_border_color, button_hover_color, button_background_hover_color) — these are valid Elementor Pro form button controls that were missing from the validator allow-list, generating false-positive warnings (#250, #255).
* Fix: elementor_data_base64 JSON parse error now includes decoded_length in the response to help diagnose LLM-side truncation vs transport issues (#254).
* Docs: Added docs/FREE_PRO_SPLIT.md with full free/pro tool split, WP.org build constraints, and gating pattern (#258).

= 2.8.42 =
* Fix: Theme handler ($supported_themes) — removed corrupted duplicate 'flavor'/'flavflavor' entries and 'oceanwp' entry with wrong option_key. Only Astra, GeneratePress, and Kadence remain with accurate settings_type. Applied to both plugin copies.
* Fix: Integrations admin page — save/remove/test connection buttons now have JS handlers (were previously unimplemented). Uses correct spaiIntegrations nonce and AJAX action names.
* Fix: version.json download_url was pointing to a 404 URL; corrected to /mcpwp-updates/mcpwpwp-latest.zip.
* Polish: Removed inline styles from integrations display and chat display; extracted to CSS classes (mcpwp-info-panel, mcpwp-action-row, mcpwp-field-row, is-hidden, etc.).

= 2.8.41 =
* Fix: Scoped API key scope enforcement — submitted scopes are now respected with a role-based ceiling. Non-admin roles are capped at read+write and cannot claim admin scope regardless of input (issue #333).
* Fix: SEO MCP tool contract drift — wp_set_seo now accepts normalized title/description/canonical_url fields alongside seo_title/seo_description aliases; wp_bulk_seo accepts items as alias for updates; Google Indexing tools now correctly registered in the Pro tool registry (issue #350).
* New: wp_create_elementor_custom_code, wp_get_elementor_custom_code, wp_update_elementor_custom_code — first-class MCP tools for Elementor Pro custom code snippets with injection location (head/body_start/body_end), conditions, raw code preservation, and dry_run support (issue #346).
* Tests: wp_list_pages pagination contract locked with RestPagesTest; extended PHPUnit bootstrap with WP_Query stub, wp_insert_post, and post_type_exists helpers (issue #353).

= 2.8.40 =
* Fix: wp_validate_seo_readiness transport deserialize error on large sites — reduced content graph query from 500 to 100 posts, eliminating memory/timeout failures that produced malformed JSON-RPC responses (issue #337).
* Fix: MCP tools/call response now handles json_encode failure gracefully instead of sending null in the text field, which caused client-side deserialize errors on non-UTF8 content.
* Polish: MCPWP admin shell — introduced CSS design token system (--mcpwp-* variables), dark product headers (.mcpwp-header), shared card/badge/toggle components, and MCPWP-styled admin menu icon. Setup, Control Room, Tools, Integrations, and Chat now share one visual system. Admin assets load by page slug so submenu screens reliably receive shared CSS (issue #342, PR #344).
* Assets: Refreshed WordPress.org banner, icon, and screenshots to MCPWP branding — removed all Site Pilot AI references from marketplace assets (issue #341).

= 2.8.39 =
* Fix: Freemius "free" plan slug no longer causes plan:free/pro_active:true contradiction when pro is active via Lemon Squeezy or developer constant (issue #319).
* Fix: Disabled tool categories now enforced at raw REST endpoint level — callers can no longer bypass category toggles by hitting /mcpwp/v1/* routes directly (issue #328).

= 2.8.38 =
* New: wp_update_media — update alt text, title, caption, or description on an existing media attachment without re-uploading (issue #338).

= 2.8.37 =
* Fix: wp_seo_audit_site and wp_validate_seo_readiness PHP fatal — extract_internal_links_from_content() now defined in base REST class, accessible to all subclasses including the SEO audit controller (issue #336, #337).
* Fix: Disabled tool categories now enforced at execution time, not just discovery — calling a tool in a disabled category returns a clear error instead of executing silently (issue #328).
* Fix: Elementor custom-code tools (wp_list_elementor_custom_code, etc.) now require Elementor Pro and are hidden from tools/list when Elementor Pro is not installed, preventing ghost-route 404 errors (issue #335).

= 2.8.36 =
* Fix: wp_bulk_find_replace now operates on decoded element tree instead of raw JSON string — prevents JSON corruption when replacing URL substrings or text that appears inside serialized values.
* Fix: wp_setup_menu with overwrite=true now clears existing items before repopulating — prevents duplicate accumulation on repeat calls.
* Fix: wp_update_page now returns slug_warning when WordPress silently rewrites a requested slug due to collision with auto-drafts or trashed posts.
* Fix: SVG upload error message now explains the XSS risk and suggests PNG/WebP alternatives.
* Fix: wp_set_custom_css now returns structured alternatives array when CSS fails loopback verification, including Elementor Custom Code instructions.
* New: wp_get_kit_css and wp_set_kit_css — free-tier tools to read/write Elementor kit global CSS. More reliable than wp_set_custom_css on child-theme sites. Works without Elementor Pro.

= 2.8.35 =
* Fix: Admin role now automatically grants full scopes (read+write+admin) — no longer requires scope checkboxes to be manually set.
* UX: Scopes section hidden for preset roles; custom role shows scope controls.

= 2.8.34 =
* Security: Block SVG uploads via b64 endpoint — SVGs can carry stored XSS via script tags; use WP media library with sanitizer plugin instead.

= 2.8.33 =
* Security: Restore least-privilege default for API key scopes — omitting scopes now defaults to read-only, not full access.
* Security: MIME type validation for base64 uploads now verifies caller-supplied mime_type matches detected content type; mismatches are rejected.

= 2.8.32 =
* Fix: API key creation no longer falls back to read-only scope when scopes are omitted — defaults to full access (read, write, admin).
* Fix: wp_upload_media_b64 now accepts mime_type parameter; caller-supplied mime type takes priority over filename detection.
* Fix: REST schema for wp_create_api_key scopes param now documents default (all scopes) and enum values.

= 2.8.31 =
* Fix: Harden Freemius update checks so admin update pages reliably refresh the update cache.
* Fix: Avoid Freemius SDK host warnings during WP-CLI activation and update checks.

= 2.8.30 =
* New: Add read-only WooCommerce SEO intelligence report for product content, commerce evidence, and search performance.

* New: Detect self-links, duplicate internal targets, weak anchors, missing targets, unpublished targets, and non-canonical internal URLs.

= 2.8.11 =
* New: Add approval-first internal link application from content graph targets.
* New: Internal link application builds native Gutenberg link paragraphs and refuses invented or duplicate target links.

= 2.8.10 =
* New: Add internal link suggestions from the content graph for SEO-aware agent workflows.
* New: Suggestions use existing site URLs only and return approval-ready link diffs without mutating content.

= 2.8.9 =
