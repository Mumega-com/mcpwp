## [1.0.38] - 2026-02-07

## [1.0.29] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- Ensure Freemius updates include Pro module files by shipping `includes/pro/**` in both free + premium zips and gating Pro loading by license.

## [1.0.28] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- Correctly detect premium vs free mode in Freemius SDK (`is_premium`) so premium installs receive premium updates (and Pro modules ship).

## [1.0.23] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- Guarded Freemius SDK hook registration (`add_filter`/`add_action`) behind runtime instance checks.
- Hardened license helper methods to safely handle unavailable Freemius instance methods.

## [1.0.21] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- New MCP tools: `wp_search` and `wp_fetch`
- New REST endpoints: `/search`, `/fetch`, and `/oauth/token` (client credentials grant)
- OAuth settings in admin: enable toggle, client ID, client secret (hashed), token TTL
- ChatGPT readiness documentation:
  - `docs/CHATGPT_CONFORMANCE.md`
  - `docs/CHATGPT_APP_SUBMISSION.md`
- ChatGPT/MCP conformance script: `tests/test-chatgpt-conformance.sh`

### Changed
- Cloudflare MCP transport adapter now supports configurable response mode (`auto`, `json`, `sse`)
- MCP notification handling in worker transport now returns `204` with empty body

### Security
- OAuth bearer tokens now enforce existing read/write/admin scope checks through API auth flow

## [1.0.18] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Scoped API key lifecycle management: create, list, and revoke keys with metadata (`created_at`, `last_used_at`, `revoked_at`)
- API key scope enforcement (`read`, `write`, `admin`) across REST routes and MCP tool calls
- MCP tools for API key operations: `wp_list_api_keys`, `wp_create_api_key`, `wp_revoke_api_key`
- Development quality pipeline with CI checks for PHP syntax lint, coding standards (tests), and PHPUnit
- PHPUnit scaffolding and baseline tests for auth, rate limiter, and MCP endpoint behavior

### Security
- Legacy plaintext API keys are now force-hashed during migration into scoped key storage
- API key regeneration now revokes previous active scoped keys before issuing a new primary key

## [1.0.17] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- Identity-aware rate limiting: valid keys get `key:<hash>` bucket, invalid attempts get `invalid:<IP>` bucket
- Removed admin user fallback in `set_api_user_context()` — returns 500 if `mcpwp_api_agent` user missing instead of silently operating as admin
- Removed `?api_key=` query parameter authentication — prevents key leakage in URLs, server logs, and Referer headers
- SSRF protection added to media upload-by-URL endpoint via `Mcpwp_Security::validate_external_url()`
- Webhook URLs re-validated at send time to defend against DNS rebinding attacks
- Webhook delivery: timeout reduced to 15s, redirects disabled (`redirection => 0`), SSL enforced

### Fixed
- Rate limiter sliding window bug: `set_transient()` TTL now uses remaining window time instead of full 60/3600s (was extending window on every request)
- Rate limiter `remaining` count prevented from going negative with `max(0, ...)`
- Rate limiter window data properly validated and reset when expired or malformed

### Added
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers on all SPAI REST responses
- `Retry-After` header on 429 rate-limit responses
- MCP `resources/list` handler (returns empty resources array)
- MCP `resources/read` handler (returns resource-not-found error)
- MCP `resources` capability advertised in `initialize` response
- `is_api_key_match()` extracted method for cleaner auth validation

## [1.0.16] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- Freemius premium activation fatal error — switched from `has_premium_version` to `has_addons` architecture
- Test Connection button now works reliably — bypasses internal REST dispatch which doesn't carry API key headers
- Pro plugin admin hook corrected from `tools_page_mcpwp` to `toplevel_page_mcpwp`

### Changed
- Tested up to WordPress 6.9.1

## [1.0.15] - 2026-02-06

### Security
- Removed `manage_options` and `edit_theme_options` from `mcpwp_api_agent` role (principle of least privilege)
- Added SSRF protection: `Mcpwp_Security::validate_external_url()` blocks private/reserved IPs on webhooks and media upload
- API keys now generated with `bin2hex(random_bytes(24))` — 192 bits of cryptographic randomness
- MCP batch requests capped at 10 per call (was unlimited)
- CORS now respects `allowed_origins` setting; wildcard only when unconfigured
- Webhook delivery: explicit `sslverify => true`, redirects disabled (`redirection => 0`)
- Elementor data validated for max size (5MB) and nesting depth (30 levels)
- Migration: existing installs auto-strip `manage_options` from API role on activation

### Added
- New `Mcpwp_Security` utility class for SSRF and payload validation
- Native MCP endpoint (`POST /wp-json/mcpwp/v1/mcp`) — direct Claude Desktop/Code connection

- ChatGPT OpenAPI spec (`docs/openapi-chatgpt.yaml`, 17 endpoints)
- Cloudflare Worker MCP handler for remote MCP connections
- npm MCP server package with `--setup`, `--version`, `--test` CLI flags

### Fixed
- Fatal error: `log_activity()` access level conflict in MCP class (private vs protected inheritance)
- MCP activity logging: corrected column names to match `wp_mcpwp_activity_log` schema
- Freemius `first-path` aligned with new top-level menu (`admin.php?page=mcpwp`)
- MCP namespace consistency: all components use `mcpwp/v1`
- Admin page hook: `toplevel_page_mcpwp` (was `tools_page_...`)
- MCP tool count: 30 tools (removed 6 non-existent endpoint mappings)

## [1.0.14] - 2026-02-05

### Security
- API keys now hashed using `wp_hash_password()` instead of plain text storage
- New `mcpwp_api_agent` role with limited capabilities (not full admin)
- New `mcpwp_bot` service account for handling API requests
- API key shown only once after regeneration, then masked in UI
