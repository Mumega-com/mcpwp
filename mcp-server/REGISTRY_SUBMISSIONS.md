# MCPWP — Registry Submission Guide

All submissions use the same core content. Do them in this order — npm publish unblocks everything else.

---

## Step 0 — npm publish (prerequisite for all others)

```bash
cd mcp-server/
npm login            # one-time — use npmjs.com account
npm publish --access public
```

Verify: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcpwp

Pro adds WooCommerce analytics, Elementor Pro, design references, and advanced SEO integrations.
