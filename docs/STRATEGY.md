## 0. The frame: it's an economy, not a product

We are not selling software. **We are designing and operating an economy**, and taking a cut of its flows.
The mistake in every earlier draft was pricing a *tool*. The right object is a **game economy** whose
currency is **coherence** and whose territory is **AI-attention**. We set the rules, we observe the whole
board, we tax the flows. The players, the agents, and the marketplace generate the value.

This reframe resolves everything we struggled with: the fork problem, the moat, the pricing. In an economy,
value concentrates in the *market + the attractor + the network + the observability* — **not in the code**.
So GPL forkability stops mattering: fork the code and you are still a player in our economy, or you are
outside it with no marketplace, no distribution gravity, no cross-site learning.

---

## 1. The board

| Player | Role | Pays in | Wins by |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| **Business owners / teams** | consumers | money | revenue, growth, a business that runs itself |
| **Builders / devs** | producers | effort | addon + snapshot adoption and revenue |
| **Agents** (Hermes · openclaw · Codex · Claude · ChatGPT) | labor | compute | hitting KPIs |
| **Us (mumega)** | game master / operator | infra + curation | a cut of the flows + the deepening attractor |

Target the **owners**, not the agencies. Agencies fork and wrap their own CX — fine; in an economy a forking
agency is just a big player who still needs the market, the distribution gravity, and the learning. We make
the economy the place value concentrates, so we never have to lock the code.

---

## 2. The currency stack

- **Compute / tokens** = *energy* — the **sink**. Metered + hard-capped (mupot `cap_micro_usd` blocks before
  any model call would breach budget; nothing runs away).
- **Conversions / revenue** = *score* — the **faucet** that justifies the energy spend. On a Woo store this
  is literal dollars.
- **Coherence** = *level* AND *monetary policy*. Coherent basins get distributed; incoherent slop gets
  penalized. The originality/approval/coherence gate is the economy's **anti-inflation sink** — it burns junk
  so the currency holds value. (See §5 — it is also Google's safe harbor.)
- **Distribution / attention** = *territory* — Google News/Discover/Search real estate you capture.
- **E-E-A-T / reputation** = *trust gate* — earned, gates the territory.
- **Addons / skills** = *items* — atomic capabilities, third-party, unbounded.
- **Snapshots** = *recipes / loadouts* — curated **mixes of addons + skills + config** that form a deployable
  vertical. Tradeable as meta-items. **Performance-ranked by our observability** (see §4, §6).

---

## 3. The components (what the economy is made of)

| Component | In game terms | What it is |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **MCPWP** | the **basin** | The WordPress surface — the hands that make changes on the site. The biggest-market on-ramp. |
| **mupot** | the **rules engine** | Sovereign agent org on the customer's own Cloudflare: departments→squads→agents+humans, capability RBAC, and the metered/capped/**gated** loop runtime. |
| **Addons / skills** | **items** | Third-party capabilities — Telegram, WhatsApp, service bindings, tools. **Unlimited.** We curate + tax, we don't build them all. Primitives already exist: `mcpwp_register_tools` (MCPWP), `register_skill`/`list_skills`/`invoke_skill` (bus), squad-packs (mupot). |
| **Snapshots** | **recipes / loadouts** | A curated **mix of addons + skills + config** = a complete playable vertical (dropship store, news publisher, local-business). Tradeable; performance-ranked. |
| **The fleet** | **controllers / avatars** | Any BYO agent runtime the customer already pays for, joined to a pot over MCP. The funnel surface. |
| **Observability (PostHog per project)** | the **game-master's screen** | We alone see the whole board — every basin's state, every loop's performance, the aggregate. |

---

## 4. The flagship loop: the self-growing, self-converting site

The first vertical and the proof. A site that **acquires its own traffic and converts it**, governed. Two
coupled loops at different clock speeds:

```
LOOP A — DISTRIBUTION (acquire)     feedback: Search Console (Search/Discover/News)   clock: days–weeks
  publish → Google News/Discover/SEO picks it up → traffic in → what got picked up shapes next publish

LOOP B — CONVERSION (monetize)      feedback: PostHog + Woo wc-analytics + Clarity     clock: hours–days
  land traffic → A/B test (Cloudflare edge) → winner → more sales → what converts shapes next test
```

**Distribution access is open, not gated.** Google News is now **automatic** (no application since 2025) —
admission is a *compliance* problem, not a permission problem. And the compliance bar is exactly our design:

- The load-bearing risk is **scaled content abuse** (Google's #1 2026 enforcement priority; 50–80% traffic
  collapse). The safe harbor is "AI accelerating human expertise, never AI generating pages at scale."
- **Our governance IS the safe harbor:** `/approvals` = the editorial-oversight signal; `wp_audit_content_quality`
  + coherence = the originality gate (make it **blocking**); brand-crystal = niche coherence; cadence governor
  = no floods. **Coherence is the admission ticket AND the penalty shield.**

### Build list (the four missing pieces — most plumbing already exists)
- **(a) Distribution-eligible:** 48h rolling news sitemap · NewsArticle JSON-LD (offset-aware dates, headline
  ≤110, article-owned image, `author.url` to a real bio) · `max-image-preview:large` site-wide · 1200px 16:9
  lead images · author entities · HTTPS.
- **(b) Policy-safe:** hard non-bypassable originality gate · approval-first (have it) · niche + cadence governor.
- **(c) Close the loops:** GSC ingest (Search full dims; Discover/News = clicks/impressions/CTR by page only)
  · PostHog Query API (funnels) + Woo `wc-analytics` + Clarity export · **Cloudflare Worker edge A/B** →
  PostHog significance → promote winner via `/approvals`.
- **Plan around the gaps:** AI Overviews/AI-Mode performance is UI-only + impressions-only (no API yet);
  Discover/News have no query/position; Clarity API is 10 req/day, 3-day window. Don't architect dependencies
  on these.

### The two dogfoods (our niche is MCP · WordPress · WP plugins)
- **mcpwp.net — content + courses (do this FIRST, it's the safest).** The system publishes in our own lane
  (MCP/WP/plugins) where *we are the domain expert* → real E-E-A-T, **zero slop risk** (the #1 distribution
  risk disappears when you actually know the subject). It also hosts **LearnPress video courses teaching
  MCPWP** — dogfooding LearnPress, doubling as onboarding (cuts support, lifts activation), and feeding the
  funnel. "MCPWP runs MCPWP's own education + marketing site" is the cleanest possible proof of the
  distribution loop.
- **A Woo dropship/arbitrage store — the commerce dogfood.** Proves the *conversion* loop in dollars, under
  caps, our-risk. Second, because commerce content carries more slop/policy risk than our own expertise.

---

## 4b. Cadence + agent representation (the governance layer)

**Two-speed agents — the energy discipline.** The economy runs the energy sink on two clocks:
- **Continuous + cheap:** small agents (Haiku-class) run frequently on the interval — *perceive* (pull
  analytics + Search Console), do small tasks, and **log what they did**.
- **Periodic + expensive:** one expensive agent (Opus-class) runs **once per interval** — reads the data
  gathered *and* what the small agents already did → makes the strategic decision → dispatches the next work,
  then sleeps. A warm-cache burst, not an always-on drain.

Why: Opus-continuous bleeds the sink. **Cheap-continuous perception + expensive-periodic decision** is the
cost-optimal shape of the coherence loop and the only way a loop stays net-positive (faucet > sink). This is
mupot's flight/loop split, made explicit.

**Agent representation — declared identity, scope, and goal.** When an agent connects over MCP it **declares
itself** through a short start-up questionnaire returning `{ identity, represents, scope_of_work, goal }`. We
accept the agent's representation and bind it. Three payoffs:
- **Owner-facing Fleet page (MCPWP admin):** the owner sees *every* connected agent — identity, declared
  scope, goal, status (active/idle), and what it has done. The site is never operated by anonymous access.
- **Second security layer:** the declared scope becomes an **enforcement boundary on top of the API key** — an
  agent may act only within what it declared; deviation is flagged + gated. Intent is on record → a real
  audit story (EU AI Act). *Auth answers "allowed in?"; representation answers "who are you, what will you do,
  did you stay in bounds?"*
- Maps to mupot's `boot_context` + `check_in` + capability RBAC — brought into MCPWP itself so it works even
  without a full pot.

## 5. The moat: three compounding network effects + the all-seeing screen

1. **Marketplace:** more builders ↔ more owners (two-sided).
2. **Attractor (the basin):** more coherent sites → stronger signal in the AI training field → models get
   fluent at the pattern → the platform works better → more sites. **Data-gravity. Non-forkable** — you can
   fork code, not the gravity well the models converged on.
3. **Learning:** more loops → more "what converts / what gets distributed" data → smarter optimization →
   better results → more loops.
4. **Observability:** PostHog per project means we hold the **aggregate** no single player has — the balancing
   lever (curate, surface, police abuse) and an informational moat (we can performance-rank every addon-mix).

---

## 6. Revenue = taxing the economy (not selling software)

Platform-shaped, not vendor-shaped. Detail + numbers in `docs/PRICING_TIERS.md`.

- **Marketplace cut** on third-party **addons + snapshots** (App-Store model). Scalable — we don't build them.
- **Performance-ranked snapshot premium** — data-validated loadouts ("converts at X% across N stores") sell
  for more; we take a larger cut on the proven recipes only our observability can certify.
- **Metered energy** — compute passes through at-cost / BYOK, hard-capped; we never profit on tokens.
- **Infra rent** — hosted bus, distribution pipes, observability.
- **The on-ramp toll** — MCPWP per-site license (cheap, adoption-priced; AI Engine $59/yr precedent) + official
  build + support. The wedge is cheap *so the economy can be valuable.*

Marginal COGS per tenant ≈ $0 (their Cloudflare, their tokens). This stays a **software/IP-margin economy**:
sell flows + recipes + rent, never compute.

## 7. Failure modes (economy-design risks) + mitigations

| Risk | Failure | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Inflation / spam** | unlimited addons + auto-content → junk + Google penalty | **Coherence gate = anti-inflation sink.** Quality is the currency-burn. (This is *why* the originality/approval gate is monetary policy, not overhead.) |
| **Net-negative loops** | compute cost > value created → players quit | Meter + value-measurement keep loops faucet > sink. The economy grows only if players profit. |
| **Cold-start** (two-sided liquidity) | no builders without owners, no owners without addons | **Be the first player:** our own addons + our own dogfood store. "Build our store, let it go crazy" *is* the bootstrap. |
| **Balance / abuse** | bad actors game the economy | Observability (PostHog everywhere) makes balancing possible; capability RBAC + gates constrain. |

---

## 8. Strategic objectives (must-be-trues)

1. **Design an economy, tax the flows** — never price the tool.
2. **Coherence is the currency and the anti-inflation mechanism** — it admits us to distribution and shields
   us from penalty. Hold it or the economy inflates into slop.
3. **The marketplace scales the capability set** — addons + snapshots others build; we curate + rank + tax.
4. **Observability is the edge** — PostHog per project; we hold the aggregate.
5. **Stay software/IP-margin** — BYOK + caps; token risk on the tenant; never a compute reseller.
6. **Bootstrap by being the first player** — our own dogfood store solves cold-start AND proves the loop.
7. **Validate before widening** — one loop lifting one real number on one real (our) site, first.

## 9. Roadmap (re-sorted to the economy)

| # | Version | Milestone | What it does for the economy |
|---|---------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **P0a** | current builds | **mcpwp.net dogfood — content + courses** | Our-niche (MCP/WP/plugins) content engine + LearnPress video courses teaching MCPWP. Safest first dogfood (real E-E-A-T, zero slop risk); proves the distribution loop + onboarding + cold-start. **Full execution spec: `docs/DOGFOOD-MCPWP-NET.md`.** |
| **P0b** | current builds | **Woo store dogfood — commerce loop** | Dropship/arbitrage store, governed auto-publish + edge A/B under caps → make real dollars. Proves the conversion loop. |
| **M1** | v2.8.x | **On-ramp launch** | Free plugin + cheap Pro (adoption toll). Admin UI ✅. Gates on Hadi: pricing (T87), privacy, install test, WAF. |
| **M1.3** | v2.9 | **Agent representation & Fleet** | Connect-time MCP questionnaire (`identity·represents·scope·goal`) → owner-facing admin Fleet page → scope-as-enforcement **second security layer** + audit. (§4b — sensitive surface: adversarial-gate the build.) |
| **M1.5** | v2.9 | **Distribution + feedback build** | News sitemap + NewsArticle schema + image/E-E-A-T emitters; GSC/PostHog/Woo ingestion; Cloudflare edge A/B engine; blocking originality gate; two-speed agent cadence (§4b). |
| **M2** | v2.9 | **Auth keystone** (OAuth 2.1 + DCR) | Opens the OAuth fleet — ChatGPT Business + Claude Managed. Bearer fleet (Hermes/openclaw/Codex) connects now. |
| **M3** | v2.9 | **Distribution channels** | WP.org · MCP registries · ChatGPT GPT/App · Claude Connector. |
| **M4** | v3.x | **The marketplace** | Storefront for addons + snapshots; the cut; performance-ranking from observability; `mcpwp_register_tools` + `register_skill` made first-class. **This is the revenue engine.** |
| **M5** | v4.0 | **Composition layer** | Snapshots as curated addon-mixes; the recipe builder; data-validated loadouts. |
| **M6** | v5.0 | **Platform hardening** | `spai_`→`mcpwp_` rebrand + microkernel. |
| **M7+** | v6.x | **Scale** | More verticals (LearnPress, local-business), more channels, the full self-operating economy. |

**Sequencing — now / next / later:**
- **NOW:** the **dogfood store + flagship loop** (P0). Be the first player. Make a number move.
- **NEXT (v2.9):** distribution+feedback build + OAuth keystone + distribution channels.
- **LATER:** the marketplace (the revenue engine) → composition layer → scale.

**Binding constraint:** not engine width — it is **one loop lifting one real conversion number on our own
store.** Everything else is supporting cast until that happens.
