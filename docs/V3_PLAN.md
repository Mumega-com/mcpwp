# MCPWP v3.0 — White-Label AI for WordPress Agencies

## Vision

Agencies install MCPWP on client sites, connect their branded AI, and charge clients for AI-assisted WordPress operations. We power the backend. Licensing and billing are handled through the MCPWP product stack today, with agency subscriptions expanding the model.

## The Product Stack

```
Agency Dashboard (mumega.com)
    ↓ manages
Client WordPress Sites (each has MCPWP installed)
    ↓ powered by
AI Chat (OpenAI/Gemini via agency's key, or our CF Workers AI)
    ↓ executes
Dynamic MCP tools → WordPress/Elementor/WooCommerce
```

## V3 Milestones

### Phase 1: Chat Excellence (v2.9)
**Goal:** Make the chat tab genuinely useful — not a demo, a daily tool.

- [ ] Multi-model support in chat: OpenAI GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini (user picks in Settings)
- [ ] Conversation history persistence (stored in custom post type, survives page reload)
- [ ] Confirmation before destructive actions ("Delete page 95? [Confirm/Cancel]")
- [ ] Streaming responses (SSE from Worker → real-time text in chat)
- [ ] Context window: auto-inject current page Elementor summary when user is on a page
- [ ] Tool execution results shown inline with formatted output
- [ ] Chat available on frontend for logged-in admins (floating widget)

### Phase 2: Agency Dashboard (v2.10)
**Goal:** One place for agencies to manage all client sites.

- [ ] Agency registration page on mcpwp.net
- [ ] Dashboard: list all connected sites, status, last activity, version
- [ ] Site health monitoring: is the plugin active, is the MCP endpoint responding
- [ ] Centralized API key management: create/revoke keys for all sites
- [ ] Usage analytics: tool calls per site per day, most used tools
- [ ] Deploy MCPWP proxy worker for agencies (one endpoint, routes to all sites)

### Phase 3: White-Label (v3.0)
**Goal:** Agency's brand, our infrastructure.

- [ ] Custom branding: agency sets their name, logo, colors in dashboard
- [ ] White-label chat: "Powered by [Agency Name]" instead of "MCPWP"
- [ ] Custom domain: agency's MCP proxy at `ai.agencyname.com`
- [ ] Client-facing chat widget: end clients talk to AI on their own site
- [ ] Embeddable chat for any page (shortcode + Elementor widget)
- [ ] Agency billing: Stripe integration, per-site pricing, auto-invoicing

### Phase 4: Intelligence (v3.1)
**Goal:** The AI gets smarter with every interaction.

- [ ] Conversation logging (opt-in): what users asked, which tools were called, what worked
- [ ] Site-specific fine-tuning: LoRA adapter trained on each site's patterns
- [ ] Blueprint generation from existing pages: "analyze this page, save as a blueprint"
- [ ] Design system extraction: AI reads the site, generates a style guide
- [ ] Proactive suggestions: "Your homepage hero hasn't changed in 30 days — want a refresh?"

## Architecture

### Current (v2.8)
```
User → Chat Tab → WP AJAX → CF Worker (Llama) or OpenAI → tool call → REST dispatch → WordPress
User → Claude/Cursor → MCP endpoint → REST dispatch → WordPress
```

### V3 Target
```
Agency Dashboard (Next.js on Vercel/CF Pages)
    ↓ manages sites via
MCPWP Proxy (CF Worker)
    ↓ routes to
Client Sites (each with MCPWP plugin)
    ↓ chat powered by
Agency's AI key (OpenAI/Claude) or shared CF Workers AI
    ↓ white-label chat widget
Client sees "Agency AI" — never sees "MCPWP"
```

### Data Flow
```
Agency creates account → gets proxy subdomain → adds client sites
    ↓
Client site installs MCPWP → generates API key → registers with proxy
    ↓
Agency dashboard shows site status → can manage all sites from one place
    ↓
End client opens chat widget → "Hi, I'm [Agency] AI" → manages their site
    ↓
Conversation logs → anonymized → train better models → everyone benefits
```
