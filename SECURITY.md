## Security Features

mcpwp requires API key authentication for all MCP and REST operations. Keys are hashed using WordPress password hashing (not stored in plain text). A dedicated service account with limited capabilities handles API requests.

- All endpoints require `X-API-Key` header
- Role-scoped keys limit tool access per API key
- Activity logging tracks all API calls
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- No user data leaves the WordPress installation (see Privacy Policy)
